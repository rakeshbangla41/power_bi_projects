## HR Data Analysis

### Problem Statement:  

The Human Resource (HR) department of a corporate company has all the data related to its employees. The HR manager wants to understand employee behaviour, retention rate, annual compensation, gender diversity, etc. As a Data Analyst, I have to develop a dashboard to answer all these questions.  

### Project Description:   

As a HR Data Analyst, my task here is to build an interactive dashboard to analyze the given employees dataset and come up with useful insights such as: the main reasons for employees to leave the company, employee retention rate and satisfaction score for each department over time, gender diversity and equality, employees’ age group, annual salary stats for each job role and department, total compensation given to management position for each year, etc.   

By analysing and understanding these results, we can know the reasons why employees’ have left the company and take necessary precautions/actions to retain valuable man power, understand how much the employees’ are happy and satisfied with the job role, annual salary and the company and come up with new processes/ideas which would empower them to work more efficiently and generate better output.   

### What I have learned by doing this project:   

1)	understood the data analytics pipeline – from data sourcing and extracting to deriving useful insights   
2)	connected to and extracted data from excel files  
3)	cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query. Those are:
   
    a)	 promoted first row of table to Headers     
    b)	removed textual errors and inconsistencies in some columns    
    c)	created custom columns in different tables as per the requirement   
    d)	created conditional columns    
    e)	changed data types of different columns in the proper format    
    f)	created a new ‘Data Refresh’ table using ‘DateTime.LocalNow()’ function       
5)	data modelling – connected two tables and established a relationship between them            
6)	created various measures and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). Here are some of the functions I have used in the project:  
   
    •	**CALCULATE** – to change the filter context of a measure/to give a new filter context to the measure    
    •	**DISTINCTCOUNT** – counts distinct values in a given column    
    •	**Direct Filter** – directly filters the table/column with a specific value in the column     
    •	**IF ELSE** – checks if the given condition is True/False and returns appropriate result(s)       

7)	created toggle buttons for switching between two visuals  
8)	used bookmark and selection   
9)	understood some important metrics related Human Resource (HR) department (employee retention rate, employee satisfaction score)  
10)	Choosing appropriate visuals to represent a particular metric/feature  
11)	Deploying the dashboard in Power BI service
